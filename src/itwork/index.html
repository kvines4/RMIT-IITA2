        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Description of interview</h3>
        <p>Interview was conducted between Logan and Matthew where they discussed what it's like to work in the IT industry,
          what interactions he undertakes with other professionals, what challenges he faces within the industry and how he
          entered the field. Video and transcript are attached in the appendix.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Interview Reflection</h3>
        <p>Overall, the interview went very well. There was a good back and forth and the topics covered were very illuminating
          as now I have an insight into what it's like to be an IT professional. There were multiple things I took away from the
          interview. The biggest would be having to be able to work with a team as you are rarely working on a project yourself
          and that you need to constantly be learning and getting to know new technologies. In moving forward into the IT
          industry, I will have to get better at constantly learning and growing as well as developing my teamwork skills.</p>

                  There was more like sales engineering and stuff, but from there, I could like, branch out and do certain
                  things. That's, I told them, like, I had an interest in doing cyber security, so they, they helped me sort of,
                  I guess, like, upskill in the areas I needed to get into that area, and giving me sort of opportunities to

                  technologies in that area and building some proof of concept and things like that. Just to test to see if they
                  actually have the capability required, we require. And from there, we can make decisions based on that. So
                  we've done that. But, yeah, now looking at actually implementing the solution. So we have to design something
                  that suits our customers. And that's highly available that, you know, is a highly secure etc. So yeah, just in
                  the process of doing that. So that's the bulk of my job at the but we also do like some security and like
                  compliance type stuff as well. So things like PCI DSS, which is like the payment card industry data security,
                  like compliance thing. So we sort of assisting sort of various parts of the company and meeting those

                  Helping out a little bit here and there are like, smaller pieces of work so I guess. Yeah. There's my queue

                  Japanese, Filipino, Chinese and Korean. So it's pretty much everybody speaks English to various levels of
                  competency yeah, like we can all communicate pretty well effectively. So, yeah, you know, language is not a
                  huge barrier, sometimes people have like, a bit of difficulty, maybe conveying themselves properly, but
                  particularly, we can all speak a little bit of Japanese as well. So we eventually sort of get me.</p></td>

                  they're not directly part of our team, but they attend all our team meetings that are essentially part of our
                  team but belong to a different department, but we work quite closely with them and I think they're not
                  engineers per se, but they essentially do engineering work and then we have an analyst as well, which is more
                  concerned with the output of some of our tools to particular on a compliance side of things, just to know if
                  people are compliant or not and then also assists with them. Bridging those gaps basically assisting those

                  have plenty of interactions with IT professionals, but yeah, outside of work previously. When I was living in
                  Australia, there was a lot more opportunity. I feel like to go to these kinds of events that the role I was in
                  there as well, was more and consulting as well. So we deal with a lot more customers and vendors and they will
                  invite us to various events that are happening. But now that I'm working just internally, we don't have much
                  into what. I don't personally have much interaction with anyone outside the company like our customers or
                  other parts of the company. So the only ones I can find are ones that I find myself. So I attend some that I
                  found through LinkedIn and they're about once a month. Once every two months, ish really up to them, how
                  frequently it is, but that's about it and that I made some friends there as well. So those people like, I'll
                  see them a little bit more often than that. One to two months. Period. But yeah, they're more just like
                  friends now rather than meeting them on a professional basis, but yeah like at the moment, only those kinds of
                  things I can find those types of people.</p></td>

                  comes to management. I tend to stay out of the higher level ones, my manager just goes to those ones and we
                  sort of, stay out of it. I mean, we'll, we'll meet with project managers and those kinds of things, but that's

                  database technology. So we need to learn like to a certain degree, like that database technology in order to
                  be able to give good advice on, securing it. So and this happens with regularity So like just pretty much like
                  learning all this new stuff and then remembering it. Yeah. That's that's probably the toughest part actually,
                  like, doing the actual work. Once, you know, it is not too difficult in my opinion about having to like, just,
                  you learn something new as right. We got this going and then it's like now, I need to learn this whole new

              <td><p>For me, not a whole lot. So, in my previous roles, I actually worked fully remote, as well. So, I'm working
                  fully remote now as well. So, in terms of that pretty much nothing, I was very used to it before. This whole
                  like work from home thing, became normal. Probably one thing i notice and I can't really say if it was like,
                  it's a pre-covid compared to post-covid type thing. Or if it's just like the company that I work in. Now, the
                  timing for me changing companies, like I quit my previous job before covid and I didn't start this one until
                  after covid. So yeah, I missed out on that transitional phase, I guess but I would just notice like probably
                  most of my meetings. Now everybody. What? Nearly everybody uses the video. Whereas previously, I never use the
                  video before covid. Yeah, so maybe it's everyone who wants to see each other's face because they haven't been
                  able to see it about being locked inside for ages. But yeah, previously like I could go into the office still.
                  So people knew what I looked like and things like that, and I didn't really need to replicate an office
                  environment because if I wanted one, I could go there. And if you know, life is just normal. Then I could go
                  out and see friends afterwards and all this kind of thing. So for me personally like me it really nothing had
                  changed.</p></td>

              <td><p>Yeah. Okay. So last question, can you summarise and like encapsulate, like what your job is, and simplify it
                  for someone who doesn't know?</p></td>

              <td><p>Yeah, I guess just, I probably mentioned already but like, just assisting like other groups within the
                  company with their security obligations. So typically, they'll be more focused on, you know, getting products
                  out the door and getting updates done on time and things like that, whereas we will be more concerned with the
                  actual security implications of that. So they may tend to want to not want to, but just like are willing to
                  let the security side of things slip in order to just get things out the door and we're sort of there to, you
                  know, not stand in that way. And that's typically how we're seen, like, the people who's saying, no, but we
                  just want to make sure that things are when they're being released are actually secure. And, yeah, we'll also
                  like we'll detect these kinds of things if they come up. So we check that before they get released but then
                  also like we help them solve their problems. Oh, you know, security domain. But yeah, that's pretty much
                  summed up what we do here.</p></td>
