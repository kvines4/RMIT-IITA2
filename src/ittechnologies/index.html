        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Definition</h3>
        <p>Servers are dedicated computers that act as a resource to client machines or programs and have become a critical
          part
          in the technological world that is now our normal. In some way shape or form, serversâ€™ power and are the backbone of
          all of our technical interconnected infrastructure. Here is a list of some common applications for server resources:</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>File storage and Sharing</li>
          <li>Databases</li>
          <li>Asset management</li>
          <li>Human Resources</li>
          <li>Policy Document Frameworks</li>
          <li>Web</li>
          <li>Mail</li>
          <li>Application</li>
          <li>Print</li>
          <li>DNS (Dynamic Name System)</li>
          <li>DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)</li>
          <li>Monitoring and management</li>
          <li>Network PXE imaging and install</li>
          <li>Directory Domain (User Federation)</li>
          <li>MDM</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Development</h3>
        <p>Servers have not fundamentally changed for many years. However, the focus of development has been on improving and
          optimising power consumption (therefore heat output) of component resources/power (making components more powerful
          whilst maintaining similar electricity consumption). In addition, great attention has been placed on optimising
          computer resources, i.e. not using overpowered individual services for things that can be done in a virtual machine to
          utilise more of the server's capacity appropriately.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Virtualisation</h3>
        <p>Virtualisation can also be helpful when it comes to load-balancing computer resources amongst a cluster of servers to
          prevent server usage overload, which can cause slow response times or crash the service altogether.</p>
        <p>The use of virtualisation, in addition to permitting live migrations and load balancing, can also permit the
          function of failover clustering redundancies. Failover clustering can result in a seamless user experience should one
          of the servers go down for whatever reason, as the virtual machine can be picked up by another server instantaneously
          or, at minimum, relatively quickly.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Traditional/Hybrid/Cloud</h3>
        <p>This concept of optimisation of server resource utilisation is constantly evolving and producing new technologies in
          which a company or individual can manage their services and server infrastructure. Traditionally, server
          infrastructure is purchased with a high upfront expense. Then additional expenses are then required for the
          configuration/implementation/deployment of services on the network, as well as the cost of maintaining and upgrading
          these systems down the line. More and more companies are now utilising web services providers that allow for external
          web/'cloud' based datacentre services and infrastructure as opposed to a traditional approach. This can be
          beneficial as there is not as much of a significant upfront cost (if at all), and server resources are not being
          underutilised, so you are only paying for what you need. Physical server maintenance does not need to be performed,
          and the services are web-based, which typically means that they can be accessed from anywhere in the world (within
          reason) and are not prone to typical power or network outages.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Future</h3>
        <p>With the increasing number of companies moving from a traditional IT infrastructure to a hybrid or 'cloud-based
          model, the demand for these services will continue to increase. Therefore, more attention will be placed on improving
          and developing these services in the future. A common example is a change from traditional network drives for file
          shares being migrated over cloud-based solutions like Google Drive (Google Workspace) that permits shared drives to be
          accessed from a decentralised environment. The COVID-19 pandemic forced a working-from-home movement where many global
          IT systems were not designed to permit such a decentralised working environment where users could access all required
          systems remotely. I believe that for many companies, this will not reduce IT staff requirements as there will still be
          the configuration, deployment, and maintenance of user endpoints and potentially some essential physical office
          systems. I think that this will increase jobs in specialised IT server infrastructure systems design, configuration,
          implementation, deployment, and maintenance due to the ever-increasing demand for said required systems.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Impact</h3>
        <p>Given the global scale of this continuing development, the users of the infrastructures that incorporate new models
          of cloud computing or upgrade to new server architecture will benefit from the increased responsiveness of the
          service. That said, however, the group that will benefit the most from this will be system administrators, as it will
          allow them to dedicate more time and resources to optimising their deliverable services.</p>
        <p>I do not believe this will replace or make any jobs redundant, as onsite IT support will still be required to
          configure services and manage endpoints. What is more realistic to happen is that more jobs get created working for
          the service providers to assist in the maintaining of datacentres but most likely more intensely designing the most
          cost-efficient optimal datacentre. Therefore some companies are building data centres below the ground or in cold
          climates where the equipment can be cooled by nature, reducing energy and cooling costs.</p>
        <p>My daily life may be positively affected by these technological advancements as for the end user for a range of
          services, in theory, cloud computing and optimisation of servers will result in a quicker, more seamless user
          experience. I imagine that this will allow designers to implement new strategies for user interface design and user
          experience that will result in a more responsive service with potentially new creative ways of interacting, which is
          currently not possible. An example is the public gaming community and how new technologies now allow for
          cloud-centralised gaming streaming. This would mean that users would not have to spend large amounts of money on
          gaming systems when they could rent part of a more powerful cluster of systems that might allow for graphics that
          would otherwise be out of reach for said user.</p>
        <p>For system administrators, this will mean that the servers hosted onsite will be more powerful and optimised for
          better utilisation and handling of resources for client requests. For businesses and individuals that migrate from a
          traditionally hosted server model to a 'cloud-based' model, this would allow small to medium-sized companies to
          better manage IT team time, so that they are not wasting time running physical server maintenance. Instead, they can
          focus on implementing services that will scale with their requirements.</p>
        <p>The advancement of server/cloud architecture will affect the lives of not only friends and family but, on a global
          scale, the entire interconnected world. This is especially evident for emerging technologies such as the metaverse
          concept, which in theory, will revolutionise how the internet is utilised and how the user interacts with it.</p>

        <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading margin-bottom-400">Cybersecurity</h2>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Definition</h3>
        <p>Cybersecurity protects the integrity, confidentiality and accessibility of computer networks, data and systems
          against hackers, cyber-attacks, and unauthorised access. Cybersecurity is used to protect assets, for example,
          companies' confidential data and information from external and internal threats and disruptions caused by various
          reasons.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Development</h3>
        <p>The development of cybersecurity is constantly growing and is predicted to have continuous growth in all areas. The
          development of cybersecurity depends on trends such as digital behaviour and current threats and risks. Right now,
          cybersecurity consists of protecting data in the cloud from thefts and threats, mobile device security, advanced
          security solutions to protect organisations from cyberattacks, detecting cyberattacks, and managing regulations and
          response capabilities.</p>
        <p>In the next three years, cybersecurity will continue to grow and develop. The predicted main areas for development
          are cloud automation, cloud data and security, which helps companies and organisations address cloud threats and
          manage workforce professional shortages. Cloud data is the easiest and cheapest way to get, manage and share
          information, but it also offers many vulnerabilities and threats. What makes all this possible is the easy
          accessibility to the internet that most people have, which can be a good and bad thing. People are more likely to
          share their data and private information online than ten years ago. In the future, for example, passwords will more
          than likely be replaced by other user authentication methods such as login apps on our devices or face ID. What can be
          done for these threats and issues is firstly to educate more cybersecurity experts. The field has endless
          opportunities and needs more workforce, and women are especially encouraged to get educated in cybersecurity. Another
          critical perspective is awareness of cybersecurity threats and performing risk and threat assessments to prevent
          incidents. Backup data, using encryption for data in transit, use software's that are designed for extreme
          security, and practising secure coding are some examples of technological developments in practice.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Future</h3>
        <p>Predicted development in cybersecurity, according to Gartner, is that in the next few years, 60% of organisations
          will use zero trust architecture as a beginning point in their security systems. This means that companies will use it
          as a base plan for their cybersecurity concerns by utilising zero trust concepts, such as access policies, work
          relationships, etcetera. However, it could be that half of the companies using this concept will not see the immediate
          benefits and not see the potential advantages. As cybersecurity grows, so do the risks. The rate of breaches is
          continuously growing due to remote work, satellite offices and mobile devices alongside other cloud services.
          Traditional security systems are not enough to secure these systems, and zero trust offers an alternative way to
          protect from breaches. The traditional systems will also be used, but the new concepts offer extra security working
          alongside the old systems.</p>
        <p>It is also predicted that next year, with ever-growing privacy regulations, 3 billion people will have access to
          consumer privacy rights in more than 50 countries. This means consumers have access to businesses' and
          companies' data. This is important to protect consumers from financial fraud, identity theft and other
          privacy-related threats.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Impact</h3>
        <p>The impact of this development is data breaches, data leaks, so-called cyber-attacks, especially against governments.
          The frequency of data breaches is predicted to grow and be an ongoing issue for private users, businesses, and the
          government. Data breaches and risks are predicted to grow in the next few years, and people who are the most affected
          will be the users whose personal information and data are accessed. Potential threats for the users could be shared
          credit card information, personal details or even identity theft. I believe these incidents will create more jobs for
          the people working in cybersecurity and in other fields when companies have to damage-control data leaks and threats.
        </p>
        <p>The more data breach incidents occur, we users and companies need to take action to prevent this. The companies are
          not just affected by leaked information, they are also losing trust and lowered reputation. This will lead to
          financial losses. I believe it will create more jobs in and outside the industry as technology constantly evolves and
          new software and concepts develop.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity affects everyone using any technological device, the internet, or any cloud-based system. Most people
          use all these daily, in their personal life and at work. The threats and risks for data breaches could happen when
          using, for example, credit card details to purchase something or when logging in to services with mobile devices and
          verifying identity details, for example, with a driver's licence. Many software and services require users to
          provide identity documents or credit card information, so most people with phones or internet access are targets for
          these threats.</p>
        <p>For me, I try to be conscious of where in the cloud I provide my details. Banks have security systems in place where
          the user gets a notification for suspicious activity, and when a card gets hacked, the user receives a notification
          and can deactivate the card immediately. However, at the same time, banks are trusted not to release payment from a
          card that did not authorise a purchase. While working for a software company, most companies require employees to
          upload a cybersecurity program on work laptops, as the employees can access customers' confidential information
          and data. Companies also have ongoing training and protocol policies on what to share with customers and what actions
          they can on their behalf to protect their confidential information.</p>
        <p>I am most concerned for the older generation, such as my grandparents, who are not all very familiar with the
          technology. The older generation is more likely to be scammed and might not have the same discerning skills as younger
          people do regarding technology.</p>

        <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading margin-bottom-400">Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Definition</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. The central to the discipline of machine learning is using
          existing training data in a software with algorithms to make predictions of future data. With enough training data
          (the more the better) computer can find patterns in data and start generating predictions with the highest probable
          outcome. When going through all that data computer 'learns' and gains experience similarly how we humans
          learn.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">How it works?</h3>
        <p>There are four types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised and
          reinforcement learning. The main difference between those types is the type of training data supplied.</p>
        <p>Supervised learning algorithms give more control and reduce bias by applying what has been learned in the past to new
          data using labelled examples to predict future events. Predicted output values are based on known training datasets
          and can provide targets for new inputs after training. Furthermore, it allows comparing the outputs with the correct
          training output and intended output to find errors and adjust the model as needed. (Selig, 2022)</p>
        <p>With unsupervised machine learning, the algorithm goes through the unlabelled data and tries to find patterns and
          trends. The algorithm segments data into clusters that have similar parameters basically creating a supervised
          learning dataset. A sample of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm in action would be an email spam detection
          technology. Semi supervised learning algorithm is a kind of happy medium. It combines both labelled and unlabelled
          data. It can be beneficial when labelling data is difficult decision for humans. It is commonly used with CT scans and
          MRI's. A radiologist will label sample set of images with tumours and diseases and lets the algorithm analyse
          the dataset against the labelled images as a result improving its accuracy compared to unsupervised model. (Salian,
          2022)</p>
        <p>Reinforced learning model is how dogs are trained, rewards are given when actions taken are successful towards
          solving the problem at hand. With reinforced learning model the algorithm does not have a sample data set, but goes
          through series of decisions, successful decisions will 'reinforce'</p>
        <p>The algorithm hence the name reinforced learning model. Reinforced learning model is most often used in robotics
          where programs run through millions of versions possible actions and choosing the ones most successful.</p>
        <p>One of the main benefits of using machine learning is using computers processing powers to go through vast amounts of
          data and predicting outcomes based on that data. Because of machine learning requires processing of large amounts of
          data it used to be a tool reserved to large companies, but cloud computing has made it more affordable to even smaller
          businesses.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Developments</h3>
        <p>Currently, most of the biggest companies in the world have incorporated ML in their business models as it is the only
          way to keep up with the competitors. Companies not using machine learning will be left behind because of inaccurate
          market predictions.</p>
        <p>According to research reports, the machine-learning market reached about $1.41 billion in 2020 and is expected to
          reach $8.81 billion by 2025. (Hiter, 2022) That is a significant rise and shows that in the future, there will be a
          high demand for data scientists and computer system experts.</p>
        <p>Machine learning is used in speech recognition mixed with natural language processing allowing human speech to
          convert to written text making voice searches like Alexa and Siri quite effective.</p>
        <p>Some other use cases where machine learning is used today are fraud detection, medical image diagnosis, automated
          stock trading, recommendation engines, computer vision and chatbots as customer service.</p>
        <p>A fitting example of machine learning in use is Netflix's recommendation system that displays videos that users
          might like. With every action using a Netflix's app, its user is creating a more personalised user experience
          based on their preferences. Content recommendation is personalised for each user based on their past choices in movies
          and genres. Personalised auto-generated thumbnail images are created according to the user's tastes in movies
          and inserted in the feed automatically. Therefore, creating tailored recommendations for the user.</p>
        <p>The cost of cloud computing and storage has come down, and now it is not only a mega-corporation tool. Previously,
          the lack of quality data sets was another limitation. However, with high-efficiency computer processors and relatively
          low prices, the amount of data gathered from all sorts of fields has risen rapidly. From sensors in the manufacturing
          environment to satellite images from out of space, vast amounts of data are stored and waiting for a good use case.
        </p>
        <p>The biggest cloud service providers like Amazon, Oracle and Microsoft are working towards new solutions in their
          products, making artificial intelligence and machine learning more accessible to more businesses.</p>
        <p>There are many open-source software's like TensorFlow and Shogun and open-source libraries like PyTorch
          supporting machine learning in applications like computer vision and natural language processing.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Future</h3>
        <p>We are already using services that have embedded different forms of machine learning. Personal virtual assistants
          like Cortana and Alexa are widely used and will gain even more traction in the future with the developments of smart
          homes and self-driving cars. Our everyday activities will become even more involved with machine learning developments
          without even noticing it daily. Artificial intelligence with machine learning will make jobs that involve processing
          enormous amounts of data less involved for humans. It will allow work to be more efficient and reduce wasted time,
          making businesses more productive and profitable.</p>
        <p>We can already see self-driving vehicle's testing taking place in various places around the globe. When these systems
          mature, there is no reason for a person to drive across Australia 5000kms to deliver truckloads of goods that can be
          replaced with an intelligent autonomous system.</p>
        <p>Jobs like long-distance driving will see a decline in the future because of that. Machines will gradually replace
          manufacturing jobs that involve repetitive and dangerous actions. However, there will always be a need for skilled
          workers that are just too difficult to replace with self-learning systems.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Impact</h3>
        <p>I see the potential power of machine learning in many aspects of everyday life. Robot vacuum cleaner Roomba 980 has
          implemented reinforcement learning in its path planning and is a great example of robotics powered by machine
          learning. As an aspiring computer scientist, I find it exciting that the tools for applying machine learning are
          readily available already in form of open-source libraries and software, it is matter of getting accustomed to the
          tools.<br />
          Increasingly in everyday life I use virtual personal assistants and find that helpful in planning daily chores. The
          future will involve start using self-driving vehicles and communicating with all sorts of AI powered chatbots. The
          main positive effect hopes to see from machine learning implementations would be increased efficiency and giving more
          quality time to spend with family and friends.<br />
          On the other hand, machine learning has already demonstrated being a very efficient tool with social media keeping
          users hooked on the content. Suggestions and recommendations are often precise and interesting. This can in a way be
          particularly useful or dangerous and it's up to us to navigate through this. </p>

        <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading margin-bottom-400">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">How it works: </h3>
        <p>Autonomous vehicles (AV) have been developed to take either full or partial control of a vehicle. AV's can navigate
          through traffic while remaining aware of other vehicles and traffic conditions. These vehicles can be classified into
          a system of levels that describes the level of automation a vehicle has. This may vary from country to country, but a
          high-level vehicle can operate completely autonomous without a driver's assistance. However, a low-level AV may only
          be able to operate part/s of the vehicle and still depend on the driver to be in control. This can include systems
          like cruise control and lane assist; in both these examples, the driver will either need to keep the vehicle within a
          set of lane markings or maintain the vehicle's speed.</p>
        <p>AV's can do this since they use multiple technologies and sensors to detect what is in front of the vehicle
          while manoeuvring in a safe and controlled manner. Some technologies that are present in AV's include
          (University of Michigan, 2021):</p>
        <ul role="list">
          <li>Global Positioning Systems (GPS): This technology helps provide an estimated pinpoint of the vehicle through
            satellites.</li>
          <li>Ultrasonic Sensors: These sensors help provide short distance data that the vehicle will need in its parking
            assistance systems.</li>
          <li>Light Detection and ranging (LIDAR): LIDAR is a 360-degree sensor that uses light beams to help determine the
            distance between the obstacles and the sensor.</li>
          <li>Radio Detection and ranging (RADAR): Similar to the LIDAR, this sensor uses radio waves to determine the distance
            between obstacles and the sensor itself.</li>
          <li>Infrared Sensors: This technology helps the AV detect lane markings, pedestrians, bicycles, and other obstacles
            that the other sensors may not be able to detect in low light conditions.</li>
          <li>Inertial Navigation Systems (INS): INS is used in conjunction with GPS to help determine the vehicle position,
            orientation, and velocity.</li>
          <li>Dedicated short-range communication (DSRC): This is used in Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to Infrastructure
            (V2I) systems where the AV can send and receive important data such as conditions of a road, whether the road has
            congestion or a traffic accident and possible rerouting if deemed necessary by the system.</li>
          <li>Cameras: With the help of complex algorithms, Cameras help the AV interpret images that are in front of the
            vehicle which can help the not only the AV determine what is in front of it, but also help the driver, such as
            parking assistance with a 360 view of the vehicle.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Future and Developments:</h3>
        <p>We will likely see the development and sales of complete
          self-driving AVs in the near future. No date has been set for when AVs will be completely self-functioning. However,
          according to the National transport commission, this could happen as early as 2025 (National Transport Commission,
          2020). For AVs to be used as complete self-driving vehicles, governments worldwide must pass legislation deeming AVs
          safe and reliable. Guidelines (both international and domestically) will also need to be created to ensure that all
          AVs produced are up to industry standards and considered safe vehicles while self-driving. Once these have been
          passed/set up, we will see further AVs being produced and more development in this technology (Litman, 2022).</p>
        <p>The future will development of AVs will also bring driverless commercial vehicles. In the next ten years, we will see
          the development of more vehicle manufacturers developing high-level AVs rather than just luxury vehicle manufacturers.
          Companies such as Waymo and Aurora are already developing driverless freight trucks that will transport freight across
          long-haul trips. Waymo is a technology company specialising in autonomous vehicles and has completed many successful
          test runs of self-driving trucks in America. Although these test runs have been successful, there is still a long way
          to go before it becomes common to see AVs on the road completely self-driving (Jones, 2020).</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Impacts:</h3>
        <p>The most significant impact that AVs will have been on the drivers themselves. The whole point of autonomous vehicles
          is to have no driver controlling the vehicle. Companies and local businesses will have to hire qualified staff in the
          IT field to help with maintenance and troubleshooting any problems that AVs have. This would see a significant drop in
          the number of workers in the logistics and transport fields that companies and local business hire. We would also see
          an increase in electrical mechanics who would have to operate and complete maintenance checks on the AV itself
          (Feigenbaum, 2018).</p>
        <p>The impacts of introducing AVs will have both positive and negative effects. Some positive effects include reduced
          driver stress, increased road safety, and mobility for anyone carrying an injury that affects their driving
          capabilities. Waymo and other AV companies are looking to introduce ridesharing / carsharing to reduce the cost of
          essential travel, as the associated driving costs will be split between people. This would also mean fewer vehicles on
          the road and more parking spots available when arriving at your destination (Litman, 2022).</p>
        <p>There are also negative impacts associated with the introduction of AVs, such as increased vehicle costs, whether to
          build or repair the vehicle, which would include additional costs for extra equipment on vehicles, services and fees.
          Hardware/software failures may also rise, resulting in accidents. Also related to software failures is the potential
          threat of cyber-attacks or hacking of the vehicle's system. There will also need to be a revamp of infrastructure to
          accommodate AVs, such as higher roadway design and an increase in the number of charging stations. Improving travel
          convenience may mean we see more users on the road, which may increase the number of accidents occurring; this impact
          is directly related to "Platooning risks". As platooning is the action where vehicles operate close together at high
          speeds, these high speeds, partnered with the proximity of the vehicles, may pose an additional risk of accidents
          (Litman, 2022).</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Personal affects:</h3>
        <p>In my daily life, the introduction of AVs will make mobility more accessible for me. If I am ever placed in a
          position where I have suffered an injury or cannot drive, I can rely on an AV to take me to my destination. With
          drivers not needed in high-level AVs, I may see a decrease in delivery fees ranging from basic food delivery services
          such as UberEats, to even postal deliveries such as Australian Post. As more AVs are developed, these companies will
          be less reliant on having to hire employees as drivers and more determined to produce/purchase AVs, which in turn help
          reduce costs to the consumer.</p>
        <p>Not only will AV's increase driver safety, but it may also help save time on commutes. Saving time on commutes
          will allow me to leave for my journey later and use the saved time for other things. This will benefit me and my
          family and friends as commuting can be a tireless and long journey at times.</p>
