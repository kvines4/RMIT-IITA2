        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Development </h3>
        <p>The development of cybersecurity is constantly growing and is predicted to have continuous growth in all areas. The
          development for cybersecurity depends on trends such as digital behaviour, and current threats and risks. Right now
          cybersecurity consists of for example protecting data in the cloud from thefts and threats, mobile device security,
          advanced security solutions to protect organisations from cyberattacks, detecting cyberattacks, managing regulations
          and response capabilities. </p>
          <p>In the next 3 years cybersecurity will continue to grow and develop, and the predicted main areas for development are
            cloud automation, cloud data and security, which helps companies and organisations address cloud threats and manage
            workforce professional shortages. Cloud data is the easiest and cheapest way to get, manage and share information, but
            also offers a large amount of vulnerability and threats. What makes all this possible is the easy accessibility to the
            internet that the majority of people have, which can be a good and a bad thing; people are more likely to share their
            data and private information online than 10 years ago. In the future for example passwords will more than likely, and
            already are, replaced by other user authentication methods such as login apps on our devices or face ID. What can be
            done for these threats and issues, is firstly to educate more cybersecurity experts. The field has endless
            opportunities and needs more workforce, and especially women are encouraged to get educated in cybersecurity. Another
            important perspective is to bring awareness on cybersecurity threats, perform risk and threat assessments to prevent
            incidents. Backup data, use encryption for data in transit, use software’s that are designed for extreme security, and
            practise secure coding are some examples of technological developments in practice. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Future</h3>
        <p>Predicted development in cybersecurity according to Gartner, is that in the next few years 60% of organisations will
          use zero trust architecture as a beginning point in their security systems. This means that companies will use it as a
          base plan for their cybersecurity concerns by utilising zero trust concepts, such as access policies, work
          relationships etcetera. However, it could be that half of companies using this concept will not see the immediate
          benefits and not see the potential advantages. As cybersecurity grows, so do the risks. The rate of breaches is
          continuously growing due to remote work, satellite offices and mobile devices alongside other cloud services.
          Traditional security systems aren’t enough to secure these systems, and zero trust offers an alternative way to
          protect from breaches. The traditional systems will be used as well, but the new concepts offer extra security working
          alongside the old systems. </p>
          <p>It is also predicted that through next year, with ever growing privacy regulations, 3 billion people will have access
            to consumer privacy rights in more than 50 countries. This means consumers have access to businesses and companies
            data relating to them. This is important to manage to protect consumers from financial fraud, identity theft and other
            privacy related threats.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Impact</h3>
        <p>The impact on this development are data breaches, data leaks, so called cyber-attacks especially against governments.
          The frequency of the data breaches occurring is predicted to grow and be an ongoing issue for private users,
          businesses, and government. The data breaches and risk are predicted to grow in the next few years, and people who are
          the most affected will be the users whose personal information and data is accessed. Potential threats for the users
          could be shared credit card information, personal details or even identity theft. I believe these incidents that occur
          will create more jobs for the people working in the cybersecurity field, and in other fields when companies have to
          damage-control the data leaks and threats.<br />
          The more data breach incidents occur, we users and companies need to take action to prevent this. The companies are
          not just affected by leaked information, they are also losing trust and lowered reputation. This will lead to financial
          losses. I believe it will create more jobs in and outside of the industry., as technology is always evolving and new
          softwares and concepts develop.</p>
        <p>Cybersecurity affects everyone who uses any technological devices, the internet, or any cloud-based system. I
          personally use all these every day, in my personal life and at work. In my personal life the threats and risks for
          data breaches could happen when I use my credit card details to purchase something, or when I login to services with
          my phone and verify my identity details for example with my licence. I have had my credit card hacked once, and I
          still don’t know where my card information gets leaked. A lot of software’s and services require users to provide
          identity documents or credit card information, so I believe most people who have phones or access to the internet are
          targets for these threats.
          For me, I try to be conscious of where in the cloud I provide my details. But at the same time, I trust for example my
          bank not to release a payment from my card that I didn’t complete. Banks have security systems where I get a
          notification for suspicious activity, and when my card got hacked, I received a notification and deactivated my card
          immediately. I also work for a software company, and my company has required us to upload a cybersecurity program on
          our laptops, as we have access to customers' private information and data. We also have ongoing training and protocol
          on what to share with customers and what actions can we do on their behalf to protect their private information.
          The most concerned I am for the older generation such as my grandparents, who aren’t all very familiar with technology
          in general. The older generation is more likely to be scammed, and they might not have the same discerning skills that
          younger people do in regard to technology. </p>

        <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading margin-bottom-400">Machine Learning</h2>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Definition</h3>
        <p>Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence. The central to the discipline of machine learning is using
          existing training data in a software with algorithms to make predictions of future data. With enough training data
          (the more the better) computer can find patterns in data and start generating predictions with the highest probable
          outcome. When going through all that data computer “learns” and gains experience similarly how we humans learn. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">How it works?</h3>
        <p>There are four types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, semi-supervised and
          reinforcement learning. Main difference between those types is the type of training data supplied.<br />
          Supervised learning algorithms give more control and reduce bias with applying what has been learned in the past to
          new data using labelled examples to predict future events. Predicted output values are based on known training
          datasets and can provide targets for new inputs after training. Furthermore, it gives the possibility to compare the
          outputs with correct training output and intended output to find errors and adjust the model as needed. (Selig,
          2022)<br />
          With unsupervised machine learning the algorithm goes through the unlabelled data and tries to find patterns and
          trends. The algorithm segments data into clusters that have similar parameters basically creating a supervised
          learning dataset. Sample of unsupervised machine learning algorithm in action would be a email spam detection
          technology.<br />
          Semi supervised learning algorithm is kind of happy medium. It combines both labelled and unlabelled data. It can be
          very useful when labelling data is difficult decision for humans. It is commonly used with CT scans and MRI’s. A
          radiologist will label sample set of images with tumours and diseases and lets the algorithm analyse the dataset
          against the labelled images as a result improving its accuracy compared to unsupervised model. (Salian, 2022)<br />
          Reinforced learning model is sort of how dogs are trained, rewards are given when actions taken are successful towards
          solving the problem in hand. With reinforced learning model the algorithm does not have a sample data set, but goes
          through series of decisions, successful decisions will “reinforce”<br />
          The algorithm hence the name reinforced learning model. Reinforced learning model is most often used in robotics where
          programs run through millions of versions possible actions and choosing the ones most successful.<br />
          One of the main benefits of using machine learning is using computers processing powers to go through vast amounts of
          data and predicting outcomes based on that data. Because of machine learning requires processing of large amounts of
          data it used to be a tool reserved to large companies, but cloud computing has made it more affordable to even smaller
          businesses. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Developments</h3>
        <p>Currently most the biggest companies in the world have incorporated ML in their business models as it is the only way
          to keep up with the competitors. Companies not using machine learning will be left behind because of inaccurate market
          predictions.<br />
          Machine learning market reached about 1.41 billion dollars in 2020 and is expected to reach 8.81 billion by 2025
          according to research reports. (Hiter, 2022) That is a significant rise and shows that in the future there is a high
          demand of data scientists and computer system experts.<br />
          Machine learning is used in speech recognition mixed with natural language processing allowing human speech to convert
          to written text making voice searches like Alexa and Siri quite effective.<br />
          Some of the other use cases where machine learning is used today are fraud detection, medical image diagnosis,
          automated stock trading, recommendation engines, computer vision and chatbots as a customer service.<br />
          A fitting example of machine learning in use is Netflix’s recommendation system that displays videos that user might
          like. Content recommendation is personalised for each user based on their past choices in movies and genres. With
          every action using a Netflix’s app, its user is creating more personalised user experience based on their preferences.
          Personalised auto-generated thumbnail images are created according to user’s tastes in movies and inserted in feed
          automatically. Therefore, creating bespoke recommendations for user.<br />
          The cost of cloud computing and storage has come down and now it is not only the tool of mega corporations. Previously
          lack of quality data sets was another limitation but now with high efficiency computer processors and relatively cheap
          price, the amount of data gathered from all sorts of fields has risen rapidly. From sensors in manufacturing
          environment to satellite images from out of space, there is vast amounts of data stored and waiting for a good use
          case.<br />
          The biggest cloud service providers like Amazon, Oracle and Microsoft are working towards new solutions in their
          products making artificial intelligence and machine learning more accessible to higher number of businesses.<br />
          There are many open-source software's like TensorFlow and Shogun and open-source libraries like PyTorch supporting
          machine learning in applications like computer vision and natural language processing. </p>
          <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Future</h3>
          <p>We are already using services that have embedded different forms of machine learning. Personal virtual assistants
            like Cortana and Alexa are widely used and will gain even more traction in the future with the developments with smart
            homes and self-driving cars. Our everyday activities will become even more involved with machine learning developments
            without even noticing it day to day basis. Artificial intelligence with machine learning will make jobs that involve
            processing enormous amounts of data less involved for humans. It will allow work to be more efficient and reduce
            wasted time making businesses more productive and therefore profitable.<br />
            We can already see self-driving cars testing take in place various places around the globe. When these systems mature
            there is no reason for a person to drive across Australia 5000kms to deliver truckloads of goods, that can be replaced
            with intelligent autonomous system.<br />
            Jobs like long distance driving will see a decline in the future because of that. manufacturing jobs that involve
            repetitive and dangerous actions will be gradually replaced by machines. But there will be always need for skilled
            workers that are just too difficult to replace with self-learning systems. </p>
          <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Impact</h3>
          <p>I see the potential power of machine learning in many aspects of everyday life. Robot vacuum cleaner Roomba 980 has
            implemented reinforcement learning in its path planning and is a great example of robotics powered by machine
            learning. As an aspiring computer scientist, I find it exciting that the tools for applying machine learning are
            readily available already in form of open-source libraries and software, it is matter of getting accustomed to the
            tools.<br />
            Increasingly in everyday life I use virtual personal assistants and find that helpful in planning daily chores. The
            future will involve start using self-driving vehicles and communicating with all sorts of AI powered chatbots. The
            main positive effect hopes to see from machine learning implementations would be increased efficiency and giving more
            quality time to spend with family and friends.<br />
            On the other hand, machine learning has already demonstrated being a very efficient tool with social media keeping
            users hooked on the content. Suggestions and recommendations are often precise and interesting. This can in a way be
            particularly useful or dangerous and it's up to us to navigate through this. </p>

        <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading margin-bottom-400">Autonomous Vehicles</h2>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">How it works: </h3>
        <p>Autonomous vehicles (AV) have been developed to take either full or partial control of a vehicle. AV's can
          navigate
          through traffic while remaining aware of other vehicles and traffic conditions. These vehicles can be classified
          into
          a system of levels that describes the level of automation a vehicle has. This may vary from country to country,
          but a
          high-level vehicle can operate completely autonomous without a driver's assistance. However, a low-level AV may
          only
          be able to operate part/s of the vehicle and still depend on the driver to be in control. This can include systems
          like cruise control and lane assist; in both these examples, the driver will either need to keep the vehicle
          within a
          set of lane markings or maintain the vehicle's speed. </p>
        <p>AV’s can do this since they use multiple technologies and sensors to detect what is in front of the vehicle while
          manoeuvring in a safe and controlled manner. Some technologies that are present in AV’s include:</p>
        <ul role="meeting-list">
          <li>Global Positioning Systems (GPS): This technology helps provide an estimated pinpoint of the vehicle through
            satellites. </li>
          <li>Ultrasonic Sensors: These sensors help provide short distance data that the vehicle will need in its parking
            assistance systems. </li>
          <li>Light Detection and ranging (LIDAR): LIDAR is a 360-degree sensor that uses light beams to help determine the
            distance between the obstacles and the sensor. </li>
          <li>Radio Detection and ranging (RADAR): Similar to the LIDAR, this sensor uses radio waves to determine the
            distance between obstacles and the sensor itself. </li>
          <li>Infrared Sensors: This technology helps the AV detect lane markings, pedestrians, bicycles, and other obstacles
            that the other sensors may not be able to detect in low light conditions. </li>
          <li>Inertial Navigation Systems (INS): INS is used in conjunction with GPS to help determine the vehicle position,
            orientation, and velocity. </li>
          <li>Dedicated short-range communication (DSRC): This is used in Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) and Vehicle to
            Infrastructure (V2I) systems where the AV can send and receive important data such as conditions of a road,
            whether the road has congestion or a traffic accident and possible rerouting if deemed necessary by the system.
          </li>
          <li>Cameras: With the help of complex algorithms, Cameras help the AV interpret images that are in front of the
            vehicle which can help the not only the AV determine what is in front of it, but also help the driver, such as
            parking assistance with a 360 view of the vehicle. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Future and Developments:</h3>
        <p>Optimists predict that by 2030, autonomous vehicles will be sufficiently reliable, affordable, and common to displace
          most human driving, providing huge savings and benefits. However, there are good reasons to be sceptical. People make
          the most optimistic predictions with financial interests in the industry based on experience with disruptive
          technologies such as digital cameras, smartphones and personal computers. They tend to ignore significant obstacles to
          autonomous vehicle development and exaggerate future benefits.<br />
          There is considerable uncertainty concerning autonomous vehicle development, demands, benefits, costs, and travel
          impacts. Operating a vehicle on public roads is complicated due to frequent interactions with often-unpredictable
          animals, people and vehicles. Considerable progress is needed before autonomous vehicles can operate reliably in mixed
          urban traffic, heavy rain and snow, unpaved and unmapped roads, and unreliable wireless service. In most countries,
          years of testing and regulatory approval are required before they are commercially available. The first commercially
          available autonomous vehicles are likely to be expensive, have limited performance, and introduce new risks. These
          constraints will limit sales. Many motorists will be reluctant to pay thousands of extra dollars for vehicles that are
          sometimes unable to reach a destination due to inclement weather or unmapped roads. Vehicles last longer, cost more,
          impose higher external costs, and are more highly regulated than most other consumer goods, so new vehicle
          technologies are slow to penetrate markets. It will probably take decades for most vehicles to be autonomous, and some
          motorists may resist them.<br />
          Optimistically, high-level autonomous vehicles will be safe and reliable by 2025. A few more years will be required
          for testing and regulatory approval, so by 2030, autonomous vehicles may be commercially available and allowed to
          operate in many areas. Suppose they follow the pattern of previous vehicle technologies during the 2030s. In that
          case, they will be expensive and limited in performance, sometimes unable to reach the desired destination or
          requiring human intervention when they encounter unexpected situations. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Impacts:</h3>
        <p>As about 90% of crashes involve a human error, autonomous vehicles will reduce crash rates and costs by 90% (Kok, et
          al. 2017; McKinsey 2016), but this overlooks additional impacts these technologies can introduce: </p>
        <ul role="meeting-list">
          <li>Hardware and software failures. Complex electronic systems often fail due to false sensors, distorted signals and
            software errors. Self-driving vehicles will certainly have failures that contribute to crashes, although their
            frequency is difficult to predict (Dawn Project 2022). </li>
          <li>Malicious hacking. Self-driving technologies can be manipulated for amusement or crime.</li>
          <li>Increased risk-taking. When travellers feel safer, they tend to take additional risks, called offsetting behaviour
            or risk compensation. For example, autonomous vehicle passengers may reduce seatbelt use, and other road users may
            be less cautious (Millard-Ball 2016), described as “over-trusting” technology (Ackerman 2017). </li>
          <li>Additional risks to non-auto travellers. Autonomous vehicles may have difficulty detecting and accommodating
            pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcycles (PBIC 2017). </li>
          <li>Reduced investment in conventional safety strategies. The prospect of autonomous vehicles may reduce future
            efforts to improve driver safety (Lawson 2018). </li>
          <li>Higher vehicle repair costs due to additional equipment. Additional sensors and control systems, and increased
            quality control, are likely to significantly increase collision repair costs. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The biggest impact on jobs that AVs will have is on drivers themselves. The whole point of autonomous vehicles is to
          have no driver controlling the vehicle. Companies and local businesses will hire qualified staff in the IT field to
          help with maintenance and troubleshooting any problems that AVs have. This would see a significant drop in the number
          of workers in the logistics and transport fields that companies and local business hire. We would also see an increase
          in electrical mechanics who would have to operate and complete maintenance checks on the AV itself. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Personal affects:</h3>
        <p>In my daily life, the introduction of AVs will make mobility more accessible for me. If I am ever placed in a
          position where I have suffered an injury or cannot drive, I can rely on an AV to take me to my destination. With
          drivers not needed in high-level AVs, I may see a decrease in delivery fees ranging from basic food delivery services
          such as UberEats, to even postal deliveries such as Australian Post. As more AVs are developed, these companies will
          be less reliant on having to hire employees as drivers and more determined to produce/purchase AVs, which in turn help
          reduce costs to the consumer.<br />
          Not only will AV’s increase driver safety, but it may also help save time on commutes. Saving time on commutes will
          allow me to leave for my journey later and use the saved time for other things. This will benefit me and my family and
          friends as commuting can be a tireless and long journey at times. </p>
