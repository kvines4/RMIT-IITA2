        <h1 class="fs-primary-heading fw-bold margin-bottom-400">Project Idea</h1>
        <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading margin-bottom-400">Barbell Motion Tracking App</h2>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Overview</h3>
        <p>Our idea is to create a fitness/strength training focused mobile app that will use your phone’s inbuilt
          camera to
          watch you while you do compound lifts such as squats, bench-press or deadlifts and analyse your lifting
          form.<br />
          In powerlifting, we often analyse effort/performance with lifts using a scale of difficulty called RPE (rating
          of
          perceived effort) where zero would be us at rest, 5 might be difficult to lift, 7 being rather difficult, 9
          being
          exceedingly difficult and 10 being our absolute maximum weight lift.<br />
          The RPE scale is one that goes by feel, but it can also be interpreted with ease by an experienced third party
          based
          on how fast the bar moves from the top of the lift to the bottom, then back up again. For example: If a squat
          with
          average weight takes 1 second down then 1.5 seconds up, but a very heavy lift takes 1 second down and 3
          seconds up and
          comes close to stopping before the top, it would be an RPE 9-10 lift.<br />
          This system works well for indicating to your coach how difficult a training plan or training day is but
          provides no
          real data that can be analysed for insight into your overall performance.<br />
          This app would use real time image recognition software to track information about effort exerted in each
          individual
          lift, but would also be able to provide insight into factors such as the centre of mass of the barbell and its
          motion
          over time, your body proportions such has how far you are leaning forward, and how deep your lift is with the
          intention of providing information on how safe your posture is.
          Server side processing will be used for all information gathering and then displayed locally on the app on
          your
          personal device.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Motivation</h3>
        <p>This app would be useful for a lot of people, as gym is a very popular hobby nowadays. The app would help
          people train safely which would result in reduced gym-related injuries. When performed correctly, users will
          also get more out of their workouts and improve their performance at the gym, which will lead to increased
          strength. Performance over time is tracked by doing a session of max lifts, and then in a few weeks time the
          user can repeat the max lifts and compare results. The app will also benefit users who train by themselves as
          they can’t always rely on a coach. When the user exercises at the gym without a coach, the coach relies on the
          users ability to track what RPE the users heaviest lifts were to gauge the requirement to increase the weight
          each week. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Description</h3>
        <p>Upon account creation, the user will input their weight and height, and their current max, average sets/reps
          statistics for a range of supported exercises such as squat, bench-press, deadlift lift. The only other optional thing
          that the user could input into the app is their workout plan which includes some of these compound lifts.<br />
          The app will be very simplistic and UX focused, when doing a workout that the user wants to check their form on they
          will simply have to prop their phone so that the camera is facing them, click start on the app, perform the workout
          and click stop. After they are finished the app will playback their recording but with a stick figure overlay that
          will show whether they had the correct form when performing the exercise, the stick figure will be red when incorrect
          form is being used, yellow when in a margin of error then green for a successful exercise.<br />
          The user will also be presented with a series of statistics on top of the path of travel of their form. These
          statistics could include the speed or timing in-between each repetition of the exercise and whether your upward motion
          stopped at all along the way. Over time after the user has utilised the app over an extended period of time, the app
          will then be able provide a range of graphs and statistical analysis including averages and suggestions for
          improvements to provide the user with their current performance and how they are tracking towards their goals.<br />
          This would be done with each consecutive lift, and at the end this data would be stored as a set for that particular
          day.<br />
          As a way of balancing out statistics, users can choose to report how they think their workout went on a scale (ie 5
          for energised and pumped or 1 for sluggish) to help the app cater for off days so that it doesn’t count towards their
          peak performance profile. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>Xamarin is a great example of a framework that could be used to create an app that would be compatible with both
          Android and Apple devices. It’s a reliable product provided by Microsoft and leverages .Net and C# which are very
          common and easy to learn programming languages and are skills that are very easy to find in the workforce which help
          with the process of hiring developers for the team.<br />
          The app would run locally on the user’s device and make use of the inbuild camera technology. Video will be recorded
          locally on the device, but compressed and sent to servers for processing.<br />
          On the server side of things, we would be making use of Google’s ML kit which is a light weight computer vision api
          that is designed for tracking the movement of the human body. Once video processing is complete, we need to analyse
          the data and compare it to previous datasets. Microsoft’s’ Azure platform provides a service known as Azure Data
          Explorer which can be used for instant visibility into very large raw datasets with near real-time analysis for
          identifying performance, trends and anomalies.<br />
          This information would then be streamed back to the user’s device for comparison on their end locally. We would then
          provide graphing and diagrams to help the user to understand many lifting factors such as where their centre of mass
          is compared to the actual path of the barbell, how their pacing was compared to previous and subsequent lifts, and
          projections of their future progress based on current data. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Foreseeable Challenges</h3>
        <p>When developing the application there will be challenges that need to be investigated. Overall, they can be
          categorised into hardware, software, environment, and business-related challenges.<br />
          Hardware on different phones varies, the processing power and cameras on devices can cause problems when running close
          to the limits of processing power. As application will be running for a while battery drainage is another issue that
          might cause problems in situations when devices must find network in low network coverage areas.<br />
          When application is used in the gym there are also other persons there that will influence phones focusing
          capabilities, like when someone walks pass and barbell is not seen by the application.<br />
          Like with every project funding is particularly important and without sufficient funding and marketing the research is
          not possible making the whole build impossible </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Skills Required</h3>
        <p>Building the application will require wide range of information technology skills, from data management to UX design
          skills. A good understanding of writing API-s for backend backed by databases in SQL will be required for the cloud
          part of the build.<br />
          Good programming skills to write efficient code for the application and collaborative skills using Git software for
          collaborative work. Knowledge of cloud infrastructure developing frameworks and which cloud computing service to use
          is required to have a application that utilises AI with image recognition solutions.<br />
          Bringing the backend and frontend together with a user-friendly mobile application requires UX design skills </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Outcome</h3>
        <p>As people are becoming more health conscious along with the frequency of people exercising and attending the gym, we
          would like our product to help them achieve their goals and make sure safe techniques are being undertaken. Whether it
          be an athlete trying to train optimally to get the most out of their workout using the data collected through our
          product or a regular person attending the gym just making sure they are exercising safely and efficiently using the
          motion tracking, we hope to offer a product that helps a diverse range of people reach their health goals. In short,
          this project would allow coaches, athletes and everyday people to approach exercise more informed, allowing them to
          reach their goals in a more efficient and safe way. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Future Upgrades</h3>
        <p>In the first few updates, we would see bug fixes and improvements made to the user interface design of the
          application and any other small details that users believe would benefit the application. After 6-12 months, we would
          see more features added to the application, such as a set/rep counter. The application will also be able to suggest
          either increasing or decreasing weight from an exercise depending on how long it takes the user to complete the
          exercise.<br />
          After a year of being online, more features will be available in the application, such as alerting the user about
          their form and exercise intensity. This will be done through cross-platform capabilities, where the application can
          link to a smartwatch and access information such as blood-oxygen levels and heart rate.<br />
          The final features will let the application provide users with a workout plan and meal plan, depending on whether the
          user would like to gain or lose weight. The application will also have a database of many foods and their breakdown of
          calories, sugars, fats etc. All the user will have to do is enter the food name in the database, find it, and add it
          to their meal plan to be able to view a breakdown. </p>
