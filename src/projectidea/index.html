        <h1 class="fs-primary-heading fw-bold margin-bottom-400">Project Idea</h1>
        <h2 class="fs-secondary-heading margin-bottom-400">Barbell Motion Tracking App</h2>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Overview</h3>
        <p>My idea is to create a mobile app that uses the phones inbuilt camera to watch you while you do compound
          lifts such as squats, bench-press or deadlifts.<br />
          In powerlifting, we often refer to lifts using a scale of difficulty called RPE (rating of perceived effort)
          where zero would be us at rest, 5 might be something that
          is somewhat difficult to lift, 7 being rather difficult, 9 being very difficult and 10 being our absolute
          maximum weight lift.<br />
          This is a scale that goes by feel, but it can also be interpreted with ease by a third party based on how
          fast the bar moves from the top of the lift to the bottom,
          then back up again. For example: If a squat with average weight takes 1 second down then 1.5 seconds up, but a
          very heavy lift takes 1 second down and 3 seconds up
          and comes close to stopping before the top, it would arguably be an RPE 9-10 lift.<br />
          This system works pretty well to get an idea of how difficult a training plan is, but provides no real data
          that can be analysed for real insight into your
          performance.<br />
          This app would use real time image recognition software to find the centre of mass of the barbell from a side
          perspective and then track and graph the motion of the
          bar over time, storing and later comparing the data from many individual lifts over many weeks. The user would
          only need to specify which lift is being performed and
          at what weight.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Motivation</h3>
        <p>Powerlifting is a passion of mine and the idea of using technology to help with my performance is something
          that really fascinates me. I regularly take personal
          training sessions with my coach to increase my strength and most of our performance over time is tracked by
          doing a session of max lifts, then training over several
          weeks and later doing more max lifts and comparing them.<br />
          The trouble with this is that I very much rely on my coach. When I train at the gym without him there, he
          relies on my ability to track what RPE my heaviest lifts
          were to gauge how much to increase my weight week by week.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Description</h3>
        <p>Upon account creation, the user will input their weight and height, and their current max, average sets/reps
          statistics for a range of supported exercises such as squat, bench-press, deadlift lift. The only other optional thing
          that the user could input into the app is their workout plan which includes some of these compound lifts.<br />
          The app will be very simplistic and UX focused, when doing a workout that the user wants to check their form on they
          will simply have to prop their phone so that the camera is facing them, click start on the app, perform the workout
          and click stop. After they are finished the app will playback their recording but with a stick figure overlay that
          will show whether they had the correct form when performing the exercise, the stick figure will be red when incorrect
          form is being used, yellow when in a margin of error then green for a successful exercise.<br />
          The user will also be presented with a series of statistics on top of the path of travel of their form. These
          statistics could include the speed or timing in-between each repetition of the exercise and whether your upward motion
          stopped at all along the way. Over time after the user has utilised the app over an extended period of time, the app
          will then be able provide a range of graphs and statistical analysis including averages and suggestions for
          improvements to provide the user with their current performance and how they are tracking towards their goals.<br />
          This would be done with each consecutive lift, and at the end this data would be stored as a set for that particular
          day.<br />
          As a way of balancing out statistics, users can choose to report how they think their workout went on a scale (ie 5
          for energised and pumped or 1 for sluggish) to help the app cater for off days so that it doesn’t count towards their
          peak performance profile. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>The implementation could be as simple as an app with local storage, but servers with databases should be
          strongly considered as the majority of users will wish to
          share their stats with friends or user their same account across multiple devices.<br />
          Xamarin is a great example of a framework that could be used to create an app that would be compatible with
          both Android and apple devices. It’s a reliable product
          provided by Microsoft and leverages .Net and C# which are very common and easy to learn programming languages.<br />
          The image tracking can likely leverage an online service initially while the app is in development but later
          on it would be ideal to write our own image tracking
          software that can run locally on each device.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Foreseeable Challenges</h3>
        <p><br /></p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Skills Required</h3>
        <p>Skills required would include Xamarin and .Net Framework development in C# for the mobile app.<br />An
          understanding of how to write API’s backed by databases in SQL
          will be required for the cloud/backend aspects of the project.<br />
          >I am quite familiar with the .Net Framework in C# as well as SQL so these would be ideal technologies for me
          to make use of.</p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Outcome</h3>
        <p>As people are becoming more health conscious along with the frequency of people exercising and attending the gym, we
          would like our product to help them achieve their goals and make sure safe techniques are being undertaken. Whether it
          be an athlete trying to train optimally to get the most out of their workout using the data collected through our
          product or a regular person attending the gym just making sure they are exercising safely and efficiently using the
          motion tracking, we hope to offer a product that helps a diverse range of people reach their health goals. In short,
          this project would allow coaches, athletes and everyday people to approach exercise more informed, allowing them to
          reach their goals in a more efficient and safe way. </p>
        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Future Upgrades</h3>
        <p>In the first few updates, we would see bug fixes and improvements made to the user interface design of the
          application and any other small details that users believe would benefit the application. After 6-12 months, we would
          see more features added to the application, such as a set/rep counter. The application will also be able to suggest
          either increasing or decreasing weight from an exercise depending on how long it takes the user to complete the
          exercise.<br />
          After a year of being online, more features will be available in the application, such as alerting the user about
          their form and exercise intensity. This will be done through cross-platform capabilities, where the application can
          link to a smartwatch and access information such as blood-oxygen levels and heart rate.<br />
          The final features will let the application provide users with a workout plan and meal plan, depending on whether the
          user would like to gain or lose weight. The application will also have a database of many foods and their breakdown of
          calories, sugars, fats etc. All the user will have to do is enter the food name in the database, find it, and add it
          to their meal plan to be able to view a breakdown. </p>
