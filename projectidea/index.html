        <h1 class="fs-primary-heading fw-bold">Project Idea</h1>

        <h2 class="fs-primary-heading margin-bottom-700">Barbell Motion Tracking App</h2>

        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Overview</h3>
        <p>My idea is to create a mobile app that uses the phones inbuilt camera to watch you while you do compound
          lifts such as squats, bench-press or deadlifts.</p>
        <p>In powerlifting, we often refer to lifts using a scale of difficulty called RPE (rating of perceived effort)
          where zero would be us at rest, 5 might be something that
          is somewhat difficult to lift, 7 being rather difficult, 9 being very difficult and 10 being our absolute
          maximum weight lift.</p>
        <p>This is a scale that goes by feel, but it can also be interpreted with ease by a third party based on how
          fast the bar moves from the top of the lift to the bottom,
          then back up again. For example: If a squat with average weight takes 1 second down then 1.5 seconds up, but a
          very heavy lift takes 1 second down and 3 seconds up
          and comes close to stopping before the top, it would arguably be an RPE 9-10 lift.</p>
        <p>This system works pretty well to get an idea of how difficult a training plan is, but provides no real data
          that can be analysed for real insight into your
          performance.</p>
        <p>This app would use real time image recognition software to find the centre of mass of the barbell from a side
          perspective and then track and graph the motion of the
          bar over time, storing and later comparing the data from many individual lifts over many weeks. The user would
          only need to specify which lift is being performed and
          at what weight.</p>

        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Motivation</h3>
        <p>Powerlifting is a passion of mine and the idea of using technology to help with my performance is something
          that really fascinates me. I regularly take personal
          training sessions with my coach to increase my strength and most of our performance over time is tracked by
          doing a session of max lifts, then training over several
          weeks and later doing more max lifts and comparing them.</p>
        <p>The trouble with this is that I very much rely on my coach. When I train at the gym without him there, he
          relies on my ability to track what RPE my heaviest lifts
          were to gauge how much to increase my weight week by week.</p>

        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Description</h3>
        <p>A new user would create an account where they input statistics such as their weight and height and what their
          current max squat, bench-press and deadlift lifts are.
          From there they would input a workout plan which includes some of these compound lifts.</p>
        <p>Each time the user goes to the gym, they clip their phone into a stand and open up the app. They would select
          their workout plan, select the day of the workout they
          will be completing and get started.<br />As they progress through the lifts they will click record on the app,
          go to the rack and perform the lift, then click end
          recording.</p>
        <p>Each lift will provide real time statistics on the travel path of the bar, the speed, the timing and whether
          your upward motion stopped at all along the way. This
          would be done with each consecutive lift, and at the end this data would be stored as a set for that
          particular day. Users might even be interested in reporting
          whether they were feeling energised or maybe sluggish that day to indicate to the app that they weren’t at
          peak performance. This is something we take into account
          with our RPE evaluation of a lift.</p>
        <p>Once the user has completed many days’ worth of this with each of the compound movements the app would
          provide many forms of graphs and statistical analysis to
          provide the user with insight into their current performance and maybe even tips on what they need to focus on
          and what is progressing well.</p>

        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Tools and Technologies</h3>
        <p>The implementation could be as simple as an app with local storage, but servers with databases should be
          strongly considered as the majority of users will wish to
          share their stats with friends or user their same account across multiple devices. </p>
        <p>Xamarin is a great example of a framework that could be used to create an app that would be compatible with
          both Android and apple devices. It’s a reliable product
          provided by Microsoft and leverages .Net and C# which are very common and easy to learn programming languages.
        </p>
        <p>The image tracking can likely leverage an online service initially while the app is in development but later
          on it would be ideal to write our own image tracking
          software that can run locally on each device.</p>

        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Skills Required</h3>
        <p>Skills required would include Xamarin and .Net Framework development in C# for the mobile app.<br />An
          understanding of how to write API’s backed by databases in SQL
          will be required for the cloud/backend aspects of the project.</p>
        <p>I am quite familiar with the .Net Framework in C# as well as SQL so these would be ideal technologies for me
          to make use of.</p>

        <h3 class="fs-600 fw-bold">Outcome</h3>
        <p>This project will hopefully allow coaches and athletes to take a more data driven approach with benefits
          spanning many areas from strength gains to safety lifting
          technique.</p>
