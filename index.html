            <p>Kristian Vines is from Hobart, Tasmania. His student number is S3975623 and his student email is
              S3975623@student.rmit.edu.au. Programming has been his passion for many years, and he considers it one of his primary
              hobbies. Most of his programming knowledge is self-taught, although he has some formal education as a former student
              for a Bachelor of ICT at the University of Tasmania. He hopes to complete his IT studies through RMIT online. His
              favourite foods are Italian and Eastern Asian dishes &ndash; mainly pizzas and spicy noodle soups. Outside of
              technology, his next biggest passion would be powerlifting, a sport he has participated in since 2016.</p>
            <p>Marek Ivanov is from Estonia and studied electrotechnology after Year 12. His student number is s3925058, and his
              student email is s3925058@student.rmit.edu.com.au. He is a hands-on learner who enjoys tinkering with electrical
              instruments. He has had numerous careers over the years, and at 34 years of age, he is looking for something stable to
              settle down with. He currently works at a model-making studio in Perth that produces realistic models utilising all
              sorts of technologies, from 3D sculpting in ZBrush to 3D printing life-sized sharks. He is unsure of where his studies
              at RMIT will take him, but he is eager to learn and interested in AI.</p>
            <p>Vanessa Wang is from Sydney, Australia. Her student number is s3930916, and her student email is
              s3930916@student.rmit.edu.au. She has worked several other jobs prior to her study at RMIT, such as a medical
              laboratory technician (MLT), and much of her former education is based on medical science. She also previously worked
              as a software engineer but had to leave the position due to conflicts with her personal life. She has a strong
              interest in cinema and has seen over a thousand films. She has been interested in IT since a young age, but parental
              pressures forced her to pursue medicine instead.</p>
            <p>Will Berger currently works as an Administration and IT operations consultant. His student number is s3697728, and
              his student email is will.berger@student.rmit.edu.au. Since being first introduced to it in primary school, he has
              always had a strong passion for IT. He worked on countless personal projects, with his main interest in infrastructure
              design, implementation and deployment, including networking and virtualisation. He chose RMIT as it is an
              industry-leading educator when it comes to IT, and being able to do the course online works well with his work life.
              He believes it will be an excellent opportunity to learn the fundamentals of many different areas of IT. He is a
              beginner-intermediate level in Italian and owns a Siberian Husky named Mishka, whose favourite thing to do is to ride
              in his Jeep with the roof off along the beach.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="flow">
            <p>Logan Hosking was born and raised in Victoria, Australia. His student number is s3976923, and his student email is
              s3976923@student.rmit.edu.au. He graduated high school in 2011 at Catholic College in Bendigo and moved to Ballarat
              for university studies but realised this was not for him then. He worked in finance and real estate for a few years
              before working in Japan for four years, mainly teaching English. His time in Japan led to his developing an interest
              in technology as he formed friendships with people in the IT industry. His hobbies include consuming science fiction
              and fantasy media. He also follows the St. Kilda football club.</p>
            <p>Milla Kinnunen is a 26-year-old originally from Finland. Her student number is S3980991, and her student email is
              s3980991@student.rmit.edu.au. She has been in Australia for over eight years and is about to receive her citizenship.
              She has previously completed subjects through Open University and finished the Personal Training course. She can speak
              four different languages and can play the piano and violin. Her curiosity in IT was sparked when she worked at a job
              for accounting software and decided to make a career in it. She loves how the IT field has many opportunities and
              allows her to work from anywhere remotely. She chose RMIT because she wants the option of studying online and having
              the flexibility for her time.</p>
            <p>Owais Ansar is a 23-year-old currently residing in Canberra, Australia. His student number is s3980135, and his
              student email address is s3980135@student.emit.edu.au. Both his parents were born in Pakistan and moved to Australia
              in 1998, one year before he was born. His highest education was a Year 12 certificate in 2017. He speaks English and
              Urdu, and can read and write in Arabic. Fun facts about him are that he is double-jointed in both arms and can rotate
              them at almost 360 degrees. He is also a massive fan of Manchester United Football Club. His main interests in IT are
              cybersecurity and ethical hacking, and he can see himself working in them in the future. His interest in IT first came
              to him while studying at his previous university for a Bachelor of Business (majoring in Marketing).</p>
